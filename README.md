## Overview

This project provides a simple web-based interface for deploying Python or Node.js applications to Dokku. The goal was to reduce deployment friction by making common workflows accessible with minimal setup.

The project is now archived and serves as a proof of concept.

## Project Background

This codebase was originally part of Novanodes, a Discord bot hosting platform that was in production between 2020 and 2021. The platform was later shut down, and this repository contains the core deployment and management components used during that period.

## Project Status

Development has been discontinued, and the project is no longer actively maintained.

Some features may be incomplete or require bug fixes to function correctly. The Dokku daemon handler (Build-Push-Deploy) API was in an early stage of development and was never finalized. Due to potential security concerns, its source code was intentionally kept closed.

## Notes

This repository is preserved for reference and educational purposes. While not production-ready currently, it demonstrates concepts around deployment automation and web-based DevOps tooling.
